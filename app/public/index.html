    <p>
We all are born with a certain package,<br/>
we are who we are,<br/>
where we were born,<br/>
who we were born as<br/>
how we were raised,<br/>
we're kind of stuck inside that person and the purpose of civilization and growth
is to be able to reach out and empathize a little bit with other people,<br/>
find out what makes them tick,<br/>
what they feel about,<br/>
what they care about<br/>
and for me the movies are like a machine that generates empathy.<br/>
<br/>
If it's a great movie it lets you understand a little bit more about what it's like to be,<br/>
a different gender,<br/>
a different race,<br/>
a different age,<br/>
a different economic class,<br/>
a different nationality,<br/>
different profession,<br/>
different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears,<br/>
it helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us<br/>
and that to me is the most noble thing that good movies can do<br/>
and it's a reason to encourage them and<br/>
to support them and to go to them.<br/>
